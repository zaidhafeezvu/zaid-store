# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for modernizing a React application from version 16 to version 19, addressing deprecation warnings, and ensuring compatibility with modern React patterns and best practices. The system needs to be updated to use current React APIs while maintaining existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate deprecation warnings from React and related libraries, so that the application runs cleanly without console warnings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL not display any React deprecation warnings
2. WHEN components render THEN the system SHALL use only current React APIs without deprecated methods
3. WHEN Redux is used THEN the system SHALL use modern Redux patterns without deprecated connect HOCs
4. WHEN routing is implemented THEN the system SHALL use React Router v6 patterns without deprecated APIs
5. IF deprecated APIs are found THEN the system SHALL replace them with modern equivalents

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use modern React hooks and functional components, so that the codebase follows current best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are created THEN the system SHALL use functional components with hooks instead of class components
2. WHEN state management is needed THEN the system SHALL use useState and useReducer hooks appropriately
3. WHEN side effects are required THEN the system SHALL use useEffect hook with proper dependency arrays
4. WHEN Redux is connected THEN the system SHALL use useSelector and useDispatch hooks instead of connect HOC
5. WHEN context is used THEN the system SHALL implement it with modern Context API patterns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update React Router to version 6, so that routing uses current patterns and APIs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN routes are defined THEN the system SHALL use Routes and Route components with element prop
2. WHEN navigation is implemented THEN the system SHALL use useNavigate hook instead of history.push
3. WHEN route parameters are accessed THEN the system SHALL use useParams hook
4. WHEN location is needed THEN the system SHALL use useLocation hook
5. WHEN protected routes are implemented THEN the system SHALL use Outlet pattern for nested routes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update Bootstrap and Reactstrap to version 5, so that UI components use current styling and APIs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Bootstrap classes are used THEN the system SHALL use Bootstrap 5 class names and utilities
2. WHEN Reactstrap components are rendered THEN the system SHALL use version 9+ compatible props
3. WHEN spacing is applied THEN the system SHALL use Bootstrap 5 spacing utilities (me-, ms- instead of mr-, ml-)
4. WHEN dropdowns are used THEN the system SHALL use 'end' prop instead of 'right' for positioning
5. WHEN form validation is shown THEN the system SHALL use 'visually-hidden' class instead of 'sr-only'

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure all dependencies are compatible with React 19, so that the application runs without version conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN the system SHALL use versions compatible with React 19
2. WHEN peer dependencies are checked THEN the system SHALL not show compatibility warnings
3. WHEN the application builds THEN the system SHALL complete without dependency-related errors
4. WHEN tests run THEN the system SHALL execute without version compatibility issues
5. IF incompatible packages are found THEN the system SHALL either update or replace them with compatible alternatives
